HOW TO MAKE CHANGES AND DEPLOY TO GITHUB PAGES
===============================================

Follow these steps every time you make changes:

1. Edit your files
   - Make changes to any files in src/ folder (App.jsx, App.css, etc.)

2. Save your changes
   - Press Ctrl+S to save the file in VS Code

3. Test locally (optional but recommended)
   - Open terminal
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Check your changes at http://localhost:5173

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Open terminal
   - Run: npm run deploy
   - This will automatically:
     * Build your project
     * Copy files to docs/ folder
     * Commit the changes
     * Push to GitHub

5. Wait for GitHub Pages to update
   - Wait 30 seconds to 1 minute

6. Refresh your GitHub Pages site
   - Go to: https://ahmedali7597.github.io/Portfolio/
   - Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R to clear cache
   - You should see your changes!

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Always use "npm run deploy" - this is the correct command for your setup
- Never manually edit files in the docs/ folder - they get overwritten
- If changes still don't appear, hard refresh again (Ctrl+Shift+R)
